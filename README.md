The command I'm going to share here is a command for getting WiFi's password "Quick and Easy". It's just up to you how are you going
to use it.

NECESSARY TO KNOW
This command is not working on "Not know WiFi's". That means, you can't just use it to get anyones WiFi password (that would be silly).
This command is working only if you were already connected to this Wifi, the password is sotred on your device andthe computer remembers it.
IT'S NOT A HACKER COMMAND (You are not a hacker when you'll use it, It's a legal command)

COMMAND:
So to use this command, go straight to CMD. and type:

/: netsh wlan show profile "NAME OF WIFI" key=clear
